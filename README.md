# Ichnofossil - My Personal Blog
## About the project
Ichnofossil is a personal project that I am making, aiming to apply what I've been learning of Spring Boot.

It is based on [Michelli Brito's course on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8iIphQOyG-AdKMQWtt1bqdVm8QUnX7_S), but I'm also trying to implement tests for the application, and my own personal vision of what this blog can be.

Hopefully, soon there will be updates :)


### Notes about the name
The Wikipedia definition of **Ichnofossil** is "a fossil record of biological activity but not the preserved remains of the plant or animal itself".

I chose this name because I intend to use Ichnofossil as a kind of diary, that will be recording my personal achievements, thoughts, studies, and whatever else I can think. If it goes well, in the future I will look at it as my personal fossil record ^^.
